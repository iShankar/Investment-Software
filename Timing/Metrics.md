1. This is from a newsletter sent out  by Charles Rotblut, CFA, of AAII, entitled "Value Could Be Gaining Momentum" at around 9/6/19. Since then, many undervalued stocks have performed well, as predicted by Mr. Rotblut. He plotted the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) against the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF (SPYV) on a one-month chart. According to Yahoo Finance, for the one-month period ending on September 10, 2019, he found that the value ETF gained 5.2% while the growth ETF gained 2.0%. A similar gap exists between the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWN) and the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF).

Here is that plot from Yahoo Finance:
