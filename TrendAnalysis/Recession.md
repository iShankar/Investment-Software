AAII had the  following plot recently (9/14/2019) that shows that volatility (measured as percentage change) was about the same this year, as compared to other years since 2011. They use +/- 1% as the measure:

Gary Shilling [predicts](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/07/08/gary-shilling-the-recession-may-have-already-begun/?slreturn=20190814132318) a moderate recession soon (as of 7/2019). The 10-year Treasury note yield will drop to 1% (Vs 2% now) in a year and the 30-year Treasury bond will drop to 2% a year (vs 2.5% now) after the recession starts, delivering double-digit returns. Bond yields of earlier years followed his prediction then.

US Prime rate available [here](http://www.fedprimerate.com/prime-rate-chart.htm) depicts this:

This is my simplistic understanding: If I had bought a 25 year US Treasury in 1981 at 18.1%, with a face value of $10K, as the interest rate dropped, its effective marketable value would go up, as the newer entrants to the market demanded higher cashflows. The uppper limit, however, is just buying more of US treasury at the lower interest rate. Say, the interest rate was 9%, then they could buy $20K of US Treasuries to get the same cash flow that I am getting. However, I might be willing to part with my Treasury  for $15K, so I pocket $5K in profit, while the new entrant gets the correct cash flow at a lower cost. So, it is a win-win. However, the bottom line: It should be a treasury bought when the interest rate was higher. So, if the interest rate drops from 2% to 1% for a 30 year Treasury, it should be worth higher by 20% or more next year.
