AAII had the  following plot recently (9/14/2019) that shows that volatility (measured as percentage change) was about the same this year, as compared to other years since 2011. They use +/- 1% as the measure:

Gary Shilling [predicts](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/07/08/gary-shilling-the-recession-may-have-already-begun/?slreturn=20190814132318) a moderate recession soon (as of 7/2019). The 10-year Treasury note yield will drop to 1% (Vs 2% now) in a year and the 30-year Treasury bond will drop to 2% a year (vs 2.5% now) after the recession starts, delivering double-digit returns. Bond yields of earlier years followed his prediction then.

US Prime rate available [here](http://www.fedprimerate.com/prime-rate-chart.htm) depicts this:

This is my simplistic understanding: If I had bought a 25 year US Treasury in 1981 at 18.1%, with a face value of $10K, as the interest rate dropped, its effective marketable value would go up, as the newer entrants to the market demanded higher cashflows. The uppper limit, however, is just buying more of US treasury at the lower interest rate. Say, the interest rate was 9%, then they could buy $20K of US Treasuries to get the same cash flow that I am getting. However, I might be willing to part with my Treasury  for $15K, so I pocket $5K in profit, while the new entrant gets the correct cash flow at a lower cost. So, it is a win-win. However, the bottom line: It should be a treasury bought when the interest rate was higher. So, if the interest rate drops from 2% to 1% for a 30 year Treasury, it should be worth higher by 20% or more next year. 

Dynamics in 2019-2020: I heard that inflation is slowly inching up from 2.3 to 2.4 (yet to confirm). Not sure what the Fed considers as inflation target (3%?). If we reach that, then the Fed might decide to increase the interest rate, not decrease. Higher inflation implies that companies and people have too much money and more money is chasing the same goods, increasing their price.  So, the Fed acts to reduce the supply of money by increasing interest rate. However, if there is a recession, then the Fed will reduce the interest rate to stimulate econommic activity by making it less expensive to borrow money. The latter scenario is predicted by Gary Schilling; however, the stock market is on an upswing and the P/E ratio may not be at historical high levels (yet to confirm). Prof. Schiller's negative yield-based prediction of recession is not definite on when it might occur. Need to document it better.
