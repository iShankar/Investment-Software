SEC letter has been used as a screening tool for a [study](http://web.nacva.com/JFIA/Issues/JFIA-2010-2_12.pdf) on fraudulent behavior by companies. In my SIP-Excel-R process, I have developed a Fraud Score ( 0 to 5). The intent is to determine if any of the companies that pass the criteria of Pat O'S Millenial Portfolio have a high fraud score and if so, is there an SEC letter in their immediate past? If so, expect that the company will underperform and exclude from the portfolio. 

Here are some URLs at SEC that are relevant: [How to Search EDGAR for correspondence](https://www.sec.gov/answers/edgarletters.htm), [Accessing Edgar Data](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/accessing-edgar-data.htm), and [Full Text Search](https://searchwww.sec.gov/EDGARFSClient/jsp/EDGAR_MainAccess.jsp?search_text=comment%20letters&isAdv=false). 

Some images are included here that show the process:
