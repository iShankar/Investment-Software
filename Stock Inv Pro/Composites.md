O'Shaunessy develops 5 different  Composites, as listed below:

1. Value Composite 1 (**VC1**) has the following criteria:

2. Value Composite 2 (**VC2**) has the following criteria:

3. Value Composite 3 (**VC3**) has the following criteria:

4. Earnigs Quality Composite (**EQ**) has the following criteria: Note that these are relative ranks
* Total Accruals to Total Assets - lowest 1% gets 100
* Percentage Change in net operating assets (NOA) - lowest 1% gets 100
* Total accruals to average assets - lowest 1% gets 100
* Depreciation expense to capital expense - highest 1% gets 100
* Stocks with missing (NA) values will get scores of 50
* Add up all the scores and top decile (Dec 1) comprises of  companies with scores in the top 10% of the combined score

5. Financial Strength Composite (**FS**) has the following criteria: Note that these are relative ranks
* Debt to Equity - lowest 1% gets 100
* Percentage change in Debt - largest decrease in debt - lowest 1% gets 100. So, for example -20% should score higher than -1%.
* External Financing - lowest 1% gets 100
* Cash Flow to Debt Ratio - highest 1% gets 100 (this is not well explained by O'Shaunessy; but this explanation seems reasonable).
* Stocks with missing (NA) values will get scores of 50
* Add up all the scores and top decile (Dec 1) comprises of companies with scores in the top 10% of the combined score
